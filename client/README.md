## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

### `npm test`

It will launch the test runner

## Observations

- The project was setup with a package - ironmaker - which helps to avoid the hassle of building the server and the DB connectiong "MongoDB in this case".
- I am not sure if I didn't abstract away the logic from the App component too much. With that abstraction, the component looks definitely cleaner, but it is less straight forward with the state setter functions
