# Getting Stared

## Server

### Install dependencies

- Run `npm i` in order to install dependencies

### Run server

- Run `npm run dev` to initialize development server

## Client

- `cd client`
- Follow instructions there

## Observations

### React

- I feel like I had a nice first contact with testing. I am sure there is a lot to improve, specially with components with some logic more complex logic such as http requests - I need to learn more about mocking and how to use it the right way
- I tried to abstract away logic from the App component and I am not sure if it was too much. The code definitely feels cleaner this way

### NodeJS

- I used a package - ironmaker - to setup the development server. It avoids the hassle of creating everything manually and of connecting to the database - only later I realised that it is possible to read and query the CSV file and use it as a source of data
